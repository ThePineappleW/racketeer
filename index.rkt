; Place all your command files in the commands/ folder.
; For convenience, just write the name of the file within that folder here.
; We then automatically append the commands/ folder to the directory name,
; so you don't have to keep writing it.
; Note that if you have subfolders within commands/, you DO need to include those
; in the directory name.
